// MARK: - Web Worker Task Executor

/// A task executor that runs tasks on Web Worker threads.
///
/// The `WebWorkerTaskExecutor` provides a way to execute Swift tasks in parallel across multiple
/// Web Worker threads, enabling true multi-threaded execution in WebAssembly environments.
/// This allows CPU-intensive tasks to be offloaded from the main thread, keeping the user
/// interface responsive.
///
/// ## Multithreading Model
///
/// Each task submitted to the executor runs on one of the available worker threads. By default,
/// child tasks created within a worker thread continue to run on the same worker thread,
/// maintaining thread locality and avoiding excessive context switching.
///
/// ## Object Sharing Between Threads
///
/// When working with JavaScript objects across threads, you must use the `JSSending` API to
/// explicitly transfer or clone objects:
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create and transfer an object to a worker thread
/// let buffer = JSObject.global.ArrayBuffer.object!.new(1024).object!
/// let transferring = JSSending.transfer(buffer)
///
/// let task = Task(executorPreference: executor) {
///     // Receive the transferred buffer in the worker
///     let workerBuffer = try await transferring.receive()
///     // Use the buffer in the worker thread
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Prerequisites
///
/// This task executor is designed to work with [wasi-threads](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-threads)
/// but it requires the following single extension:
/// The wasi-threads implementation should listen to the `message` event
/// from spawned Web Workers, and forward the message to the main thread
/// by calling `_swjs_enqueue_main_job_from_worker`.
///
/// ## Basic Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create an executor with 4 worker threads
/// let executor = try await WebWorkerTaskExecutor(numberOfThreads: 4)
/// defer { executor.terminate() }
///
/// // Execute a task on a worker thread
/// let task = Task(executorPreference: executor) {
///     // This runs on a worker thread
///     return performHeavyComputation()
/// }
/// let result = await task.value
///
/// // Run a block on a worker thread
/// await withTaskExecutorPreference(executor) {
///     // This entire block runs on a worker thread
///     performHeavyComputation()
/// }
///
/// // Execute multiple tasks in parallel
/// await withTaskGroup(of: Int.self) { group in
///     for i in 0..<10 {
///         group.addTask(executorPreference: executor) {
///             // Each task runs on a worker thread
///             return fibonacci(i)
///         }
///     }
///
///     for await result in group {
///         // Process results as they complete
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Scheduling invariants
///
/// * Jobs enqueued on a worker are guaranteed to run within the same macrotask in which they were scheduled.
///
/// ## Known limitations
///
/// Currently, the Cooperative Global Executor of Swift runtime has a bug around
/// main executor detection. The issue leads to ignoring the `@MainActor`
/// attribute, which is supposed to run tasks on the main thread, when this web
/// worker executor is preferred.
///
/// ```swift
/// func run(executor: WebWorkerTaskExecutor) async {
///   await withTaskExecutorPreference(executor) {
///     // This block runs on the Web Worker thread.
///     await MainActor.run {
///         // This block should run on the main thread, but it runs on
///         // the Web Worker thread.
///     }
///   }
///   // Back to the main thread.
/// }
/// ````

    /// threads to be properly initialized before returning.
    ///
    /// The number of threads should typically match the number of available CPU cores
    /// for CPU-bound workloads. For I/O-bound workloads, you might benefit from more
    /// threads than CPU cores.
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// // Create an executor with 4 worker threads
    /// let executor = try await WebWorkerTaskExecutor(numberOfThreads: 4)
    ///
    /// // Always terminate the executor when you're done with it
    /// defer { executor.terminate() }

    /// // Use the executor...

    ///   - numberOfThreads: The number of Web Worker threads to spawn.

    /// It's recommended to use a `defer` statement immediately after creating the executor
