/// A temporary object intended to send a JavaScript object from one thread to another.
///
/// `JSSending` provides a way to safely transfer or clone JavaScript objects between threads
/// in a multi-threaded WebAssembly environment.
///
/// There are two primary ways to use `JSSending`:
/// 1. Transfer an object (`JSSending.transfer`) - The original object becomes unusable
/// 2. Clone an object (`JSSending.init`) - Creates a copy, original remains usable
///
/// To receive a sent object on the destination thread, call the `receive()` method.
///
/// - Note: `JSSending` is `Sendable` and can be safely shared across thread boundaries.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// // Transfer an object to another thread
/// let buffer = JSObject.global.Uint8Array.object!.new(100).buffer.object!
/// let transferring = JSSending.transfer(buffer)
///
/// // Receive the object on a worker thread
/// let executor = try await WebWorkerTaskExecutor(numberOfThreads: 1)
/// Task(executorPreference: executor) {
///     let receivedBuffer = try await transferring.receive()
///     // Use the received buffer
/// }
///
/// // Clone an object for use in another thread
/// let object = JSObject.global.Object.object!.new()
/// object["test"] = "Hello, World!"
/// let cloning = JSSending(object)
///
/// Task(executorPreference: executor) {
///     let receivedObject = try await cloning.receive()
///     // Use the received object
/// }
/// ```
